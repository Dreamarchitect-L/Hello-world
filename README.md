# Hello-world
The first repository I create to learn how to use the github.

I'm very happy to know you who read the README that I edit. I'm new to here so if you don't mind and have time, I wish you could help me with coding and my English as my mother language is not English. 

Anyway, I'm extremely appreciate you read the text(I don't know how to call it) and could you give me a star?

My English is not good so there may be many mistakes. If you find it, you can correct it for me. Thank you very much.
